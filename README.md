/pay player mining-coins 10k     # 10,000
/pay player farm-coins 1.5M      # 1,500,000
/pay player tokens 2B            # 2,000,000,000

# Bulk payment to all online players
/payall farm-coins 1000          # Pay 1000 farm-coins to everyone online

# Console usage (TODAPODEROSA! üòÑ)
payall savia 1000                # From console - bypasses ALL restrictions!
payall farm-coins 500            # No balance check, no cooldowns, no limits!

## Database

PayEdtools supports two database types:

### SQLite (Default)
- Automatically created in plugin folder
- No additional setup required
- Perfect for small to medium servers

### MySQL
```yaml
database:
  type: "MYSQL"
  mysql:
    host: "localhost"
    port: 3306
    database: "payedtools"
    username: "root"
    password: "password"
```

## Performance

PayEdtools is optimized for production use and high-load servers:

### Core Optimizations
- **Async Operations:** All database operations are async
- **Connection Pooling:** HikariCP for MySQL with optimized settings
- **Batch Processing:** Process up to 200 transactions per batch
- **Balance Caching:** 30-second cache for player balances
- **Thread Pool:** 12 threads for async operations
- **Memory Management:** Automatic cleanup and cache management

### High-Load Optimizations
- **PayAll Command:** Optimized bulk payments with batch processing
  - **Console Support:** Can be executed from console (console bypasses all limits - TODAPODEROSA! üòÑ)
- **Tab Completion Cache:** Cached player names for faster suggestions
- **Performance Metrics:** Real-time monitoring of system performance
- **Database Indexes:** Optimized indexes for fast queries
- **Connection Pool:** 20 max connections, 5 minimum idle for MySQL

### Performance Monitoring
- **Real-time Metrics:** Track transaction success rates and processing times
- **Cache Performance:** Monitor cache hit ratios
- **Database Stats:** Track operations and batch processing efficiency
- **Error Tracking:** Monitor failed transactions and rollbacks

### Performance Testing System
- **Stress Tests:** Simulate high-load scenarios with multiple concurrent players
- **Load Tests:** Gradually increase load to find breaking points
- **Benchmark Tests:** Comprehensive testing with different transaction scenarios
- **Simulated Players:** Create virtual players for realistic testing
- **Detailed Reports:** Track TPS, success rates, and processing times
- **Configurable Tests:** Customize test parameters for different scenarios

## Integration

### PlaceholderAPI
Full PlaceholderAPI support in all messages. Configure in config.yml:
```yaml
integrations:
  placeholderapi:
    enabled: true
```

### Discord Webhooks
Log large transactions to Discord:
```yaml
integrations:
  discord:
    enabled: true
    webhook-url: "your-webhook-url"
    log-threshold: 1000000
```

## Troubleshooting

### Enable Debug Mode
```yaml
settings:
  debug: true
```

### Common Issues

**Currency not found:**
- Ensure the currency exists in EdTools
- Check spelling (case-sensitive)
- Verify currency is not blocked in config

**Insufficient funds:**
- Remember tax is added to the amount
- Check actual balance with EdTools commands

**Rate limit exceeded:**
- Wait for the time window to reset
- Adjust rate-limit settings in config

## API for Developers

PayEdtools can be used as a dependency in your own plugins:

```java
PayEdtools api = (PayEdtools) Bukkit.getPluginManager().getPlugin("PayEdtools");

// Process a transaction programmatically
api.getTransactionManager().processTransaction(
    senderUUID,
    receiverUUID,
    "farm-coins",
    1000.0,
    true
).thenAccept(result -> {
    if (result.isSuccess()) {
        // Transaction successful
    }
});
```
